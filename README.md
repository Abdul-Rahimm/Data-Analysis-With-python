# Data-Analysis-With-python
This repo contains all the labs of the course which is available on Coursera, by the same name. 

## Week 1 - Importing Datasets
I learned how to understand data and how to use the libraries in Python such as Pandas to import data from multiple sources(csv,xlsx etc). 
I then learned how to perform some basic tasks to explore and analyze the imported data set.

## Week 2 - Data Cleaning/Wrangling
I learned how to perform some fundamental data cleaning tasks that, together, form the pre-processing phase of data analysis. 
These tasks include:
- handling missing values in data,
- formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent,
- normalizing data,
- grouping data values into bins,
- and converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables.

## Week 3 - Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)
I learned what is meant by exploratory data analysis, and how to perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as:
1. mean,
2. median,
3. mode, and
4. quartile values,
and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data.
I also learned about:
- putting data into groups to help visualize the data better,
- how to use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables,
- and  how to use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables.

## Week 4 - Model Development
I learned what explanatory variable and the response variable is and understood the differences between the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. 
I also learned:
1. how to evaluate a model using visualization,
2. about polynomial regression and pipelines.
3. how to interpret and use the R-squared and the mean square error measures to perform in-sample evaluations to numerically evaluate a model.
4. And lastly, learned about prediction and decision making when determining if our model is correct.

## Week 5 - Model Evaluation
I learned about the importance of model evaluation and discuss different data model refinement techniques. 
1. Model selection and how to identify overfitting and underfitting in a predictive model.
2. Using Ridge Regression to regularize and reduce standard errors to prevent overfitting a regression model
3. How to use the Grid Search method to tune the hyperparameters(alpha) of an estimator.
